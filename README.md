# ToDoList-JavaScript-ES6
A Todo list web app that uses Bootstrap and ES6. Also the users data is stored through the localStorage, 
so that when ever the application is refreshed, or closed and then re-opened, all to do objectives will still be displayed. 
When changing the window screen size, the web page will also automatically re adjust to its appropriate sizes.

Below is a video demo of what the web page does
